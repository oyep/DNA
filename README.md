# plasmids
Plasmids referenced in oyep repos can be referenced from here. They are generally split into two major categories. Regular and CRISPR. 
Regular plasmids will only require a basic heat shock transformation protocol as described in the transform repo. 
Many CRISPR plasmids will require additional cloning protocols and dna template strands as described in the CRISPR repo.
