# plasmids
Plasmids referenced in oyep repos can be referenced from here.
They are generally split into two major categories. Regular and CRISPR.
Regular plasmids will only require a basic heat shock transformation protocol
as described in the transform repo.
Many CRISPR plasmids will require additional cloning protocols and dna template
strands as described in the CRISPR repo.
